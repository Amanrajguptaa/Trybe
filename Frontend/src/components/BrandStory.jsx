          Not Just Clothing... A Statement ⚡️
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          At <span className="font-bold">TRYBE</span>, we don't just make clothes — we make culture. We're born from the back alleys and bold voices of the streets, where graffiti is gospel and attitude is everything.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Our threads speak louder than words. Every oversized tee, every jagged edge, every unapologetic graphic is a tribute to those who live unfiltered and unapologetic. Inspired by the pulse of neon-lit nights, underground rap cyphers, and the static between chaos and art — TRYBE is more than fabric. It’s fire stitched into seams.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          We’re not here to fit in. We’re here to build a tribe of rule-breakers, change-makers, and storytellers who turn heads, break norms, and leave marks. You don’t wear TRYBE. TRYBE wears you — loud, bold, and untamed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8">
          This is your TRYBE. Welcome to the rebellion 🔥
